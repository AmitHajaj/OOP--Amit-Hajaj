This package is the first part in an ongoing project.
At this part we can build a graph and nodes, and connect them. When the graph is built we can use Graph_Algo class to perform some algorithms on it.

We have here 3 classes which implements 3 interfaces.

First class represent a node in graph. Neighbors of each node are held in HashMap.

Second class represent a graph. The graph has nodes and edges. Edge defined as existence of a nodes in others neighbors list.
Graph nodes held in a HashSet and the graph itself in a HashMap.

Third class represent some algorithms that can be performed on a graph. At this class i use in BFS and DFS based algorithms.
Moreover, the shortest path algorithm uses a queue implemented with linked list.(FIFO)

#Languages
This part of the project implemented with Java.
